# Internship-Code
This repository contains all code that I have written and/or collaborated on at any of the internships I have been apart of.

2. edit the file by right-clicking it in File Explorer. 
3. Press "edit with IDLE" or "edit with Notepad++"
4. Find the Section that says "ONLY EDIT THINGS ..."
