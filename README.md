# Internship-Code
This repository contains all code that I have written and/or collaborated on at any of the internships I have been apart of.

#INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Place this file in your "rawdata - local" folder on your desktop. DO NOT PLACE THIS IN THE CLUSTER "rawdata" FOLDER
2. edit the file by right-clicking it in File Explorer. 
3. Press "edit with IDLE" or "edit with Notepad++"
4. Find the Section that says "ONLY EDIT THINGS ..."
5. Edit it like we do for the perl script for  folder that you wish to sort(Ex: x383)
6. Go to the search bar in the bottom left and type in "command prompt". Hit enter
7. You should get a black terminal window to open. Type the following commands
8. "cd Desktop"
9. "cd raw" then press tab
10. now you are in the proper place to run the script. This window is seperate from the putty window, as that only deals with stuff on the GLAD cluster
11. now, type in the name of the script. 
12. sort_pix.py and hit enter
13. this will run the script. If you want to run it again, just edit the script to the new folder you want to sort and then type in "sort_pix.py" again
